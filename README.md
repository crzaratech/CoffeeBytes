# CoffeeBytes

Hey there! *CoffeeBytes* is a program that intents to teach the basics of Python with a simple step-by-step approach that will help you get introduced to the world of programming. You can program at your own pace online or you can come with us to class, and learn in a fun way!

## Where do i start?

The lessons read like an interactive notebook where you can just click the [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com) button, and run the virtual environment with your Google account! No **installations**, no **multiple tabs**, just one interactive notebook that you can read and program with. 

If for some reason you don't see an 'Open in Colab' badge, **don't panic!** just click here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com) and copy/paste the lesson that you see on github.

Whether you are new to programming or an avid coder looking to start using Python you can be sure that you will find this program useful.
