IF you recall what we covered in the first lesson (week 1) we mentioned that the way we display to the screen '**Print**' is a function! We also mentioned that there are several of these on the python [standard libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). But what if, there's no function for what i want to do? What if the function doesn't quite do what i need for a program? Well, in that case, we build our own functions! Don't worry, it's easier than it sounds. Lets look at the following example:"
